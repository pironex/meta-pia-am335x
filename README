Machine specific OpenEmbedded overlay for AM335x and AM35x based 
boards by pironex.

This repo will also include image and package specific changes
used to generate images for piA-AM335x and piA-AM35x.

It is planned to port the outdated piA-AM35x images and packages to
this layer (initial recipes for u-boot/kernel are done).
